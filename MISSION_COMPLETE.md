## Quality Guarantees

### ✅ Complete Coverage
Every task, goal, and requirement from `DEV_PLAN.md` has been mapped to specific GitHub issues:
- **Backend APIs:** All FastAPI endpoints covered
- **ML Models:** Both Random Forest and MLP with MLFlow tracking
- **Data Pipeline:** Synthetic data generation and validation
- **Frontend:** Streamlit MVP and React migration planning
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, testing, performance optimization
- **Documentation:** Thesis materials, ethics, demo preparation

### ✅ Actionable Structure
Each issue includes:
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable outcomes
- **Implementation Notes:** Technical guidance and considerations
- **File Modification Lists:** Exact files to create/modify
- **Definition of Done:** Clear completion criteria
- **Priority Levels:** High/medium/low priority assignments
- **Dependencies:** Relationships between issues

### ✅ Professional Organization
- **Milestone-driven:** 5 phases with realistic due dates
- **Label System:** 15 organized labels for tracking and filtering
- **Priority Management:** High-priority path for core functionality
- **Timeline Alignment:** 6-week schedule matches original DEV_PLAN.md

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# View the issue summary
python3 create_github_issues.py --method=display

# Generate GitHub CLI commands
python3 create_github_issues.py --method=commands > github_setup.sh
```

### 2. Issue Creation Options
- **Automated:** Use `github_issues.json` with GitHub API
- **Semi-automated:** Run generated GitHub CLI commands
- **Manual:** Copy from `DETAILED_ISSUES.md` 

### 3. Development Kickoff
Start with these high-priority issues:
1. Issue #1: Scale synthetic dataset
2. Issue #3: FastAPI authentication
3. Issue #4: Data upload endpoints
4. Issue #6: Random Forest training
5. Issue #8: Prediction endpoint

## Success Validation
