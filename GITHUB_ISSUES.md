## Detailed Issues

### Phase 1 Issues

#### Issue #1: Scale synthetic dataset to 5000 records with improved validation
**Labels:** `phase-1`, `ml`, `high-priority`  
**Milestone:** Phase 1: Setup + Data

**Description:**
Scale the current synthetic dataset from its current size to approximately 5000 records to ensure model viability during training. The dataset should maintain proper distributions and realistic demographic + habits data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Generate synthetic dataset with N≈5000 records
- [ ] Validate data distributions are realistic and consistent
- [ ] Ensure demographic and habits data follows expected patterns
- [ ] Create both training dataset (train.csv) and small test datasets
- [ ] Place datasets under `backend/api/data/datasets/` directory
- [ ] Verify no data quality issues (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
- [ ] Document data generation process and validation rules

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing generator in `backend/api/data/generator.py` as starting point
- Keep current regression target (biological_age) for continuity
- Consider adding data validation checks and summary statistics
- Ensure reproducibility with random seeds

**Files to Modify:**
- `backend/api/data/generator.py`
- `backend/api/data/datasets/` (create directory if needed)

**Definition of Done:**
- Datasets are generated and placed in correct location
- Data quality validation passes
- Dataset size meets requirements (≈5000 records)
- Documentation is updated with data generation process

#### Issue #2: Validate synthetic data distributions and implement quality checks
**Labels:** `phase-1`, `ml`, `testing`, `medium-priority`  
**Milestone:** Phase 1: Setup + Data

- [ ] Create data validation pipeline/script
- [ ] Validate age distributions follow realistic patterns
- [ ] Verify genetic markers have appropriate frequencies
- [ ] Check lifestyle/habits data for logical consistency
