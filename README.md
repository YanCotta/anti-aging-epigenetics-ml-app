## üîê Authentication System

**Fully implemented JWT-based authentication:**
- **User Registration**: `/signup` with password strength validation
- **Login**: `/token` OAuth2-compatible endpoint
- **Protected Routes**: JWT token validation for all user endpoints
- **User Context**: `/me` endpoint for current user information
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, configurable JWT secrets

## Architecture (implemented)

- **Backend**: `FastAPI` + `SQLAlchemy` + JWT (`python-jose`, `passlib`), served by `uvicorn` ‚úÖ
- **Authentication**: JWT token system with password hashing and OAuth2 flow ‚úÖ
- **Data**: PostgreSQL (Dockerized) for users/profiles/habits + synthetic datasets ‚úÖ
- **ML**: Random Forest (scikit-learn) and MLP (PyTorch) planned; preprocessing with sklearn
- **Explainability**: ONNX/SHAP planned for model explanations
- **Tracking**: `MLflow` integration planned for experiment management
- **Frontend**: Streamlit MVP for thesis defense; Next.js/React migration planned
- **Ops**: Docker Compose with services for `db`, `fastapi`, `streamlit`, `nginx`, and `mlflow`

## Services (docker-compose)

- `db`: Postgres database with health check.
- `fastapi`: API at `http://localhost:8001` (Swagger at `/docs`), mounted from `backend/`.
- `streamlit`: UI at `http://localhost:8501`, calls the FastAPI service.
- `mlflow`: Tracking UI at `http://localhost:5000` (artifacts volume-mounted).
- `nginx`: Proxy (kept from legacy; routing updates to FastAPI pending).

## Frontend Strategy

- Streamlit-first for rapid iteration and defense demo.
- Post-defense: migrate/expand to Next.js/React reusing the same API contracts.
