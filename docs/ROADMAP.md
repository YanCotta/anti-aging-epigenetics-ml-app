## üéì Academic Guidance and Research Strategy

### **Advisor Recommendations (Prof. Fabr√≠cio)**

**Core Research Question**: *"In what scenarios does a neural network really become important and useful compared to simple linear models?"*

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Baseline Testing First**: Start with Linear Regression to establish minimum performance
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net ‚Üí Random Forest ‚Üí Neural Networks  
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Systematically compare all model paradigms
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Focus on when additional complexity is justified

### **Research Enhancement Opportunities**

**Fuzzy Logic Integration**: Research existing implementations in similar domains and compare efficacy against traditional methods. Develop prototype integrating fuzzy logic, test with real-world data, and document performance improvements.

### **Model Comparison Framework**
- **Linear Models**: Baseline performance establishment
- **Tree-Based**: Random Forest ensemble methods
- **Neural Networks**: MLP with complexity justification
- **Advanced**: Future integration of transformers, GNNs, multi-agent systems
