# Anti-Aging ML Application - Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** September 21, 2025  
**Current Status:** ðŸš¨ Development Paused - Critical Issues Identified

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PAUSE

### **MANDATORY STOP: Scientific Validity Issues Discovered**

All development must pause until fundamental data and analysis issues are resolved. Our comprehensive analysis revealed scientifically implausible results that invalidate current synthetic data and model performance.

### **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**

1. **ðŸ”´ Unrealistic Age Correlation (0.945)**: Current synthetic data shows impossible age-biological age correlation. Real aging research maximum: 0.6-0.8
2. **ðŸ”´ Implausible Model Performance**: RÂ² 0.97, MAE 2 years - unprecedented for biological aging (real: RÂ² 0.6-0.8, MAE 4-8 years)
3. **ðŸ”´ Missing Genomics Standards**: No Hardy-Weinberg testing, population controls, proper genetic encoding
4. **ðŸ”´ Insufficient Statistical Rigor**: No multiple testing correction, confidence intervals, significance testing

### **Required Actions Before Resuming Development**

**Must Complete Issues #43-48 (Created September 21, 2025):**

- **Issue #43**: URGENT synthetic data realism overhaul 
- **Issue #44**: Genomics-specific preprocessing pipeline
- **Issue #45**: Realistic model performance baselines
- **Issue #46**: Advanced feature engineering for aging biology
- **Issue #47**: Statistical rigor and multiple testing correction
- **Issue #48**: Repository structure cleanup âœ… IN PROGRESS

### **Expected Outcomes After Fixes**
- Model performance will drop to realistic levels (this is scientifically correct)
- Feature importance will become biologically plausible
- Results will be defensible in thesis/peer review context
- Statistical analysis will meet genomics research standards
