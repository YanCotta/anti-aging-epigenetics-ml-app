## 🏗️ System Architecture

This is the authoritative architecture for building the MVP and preparing thesis materials. The system consolidates FastAPI for the API layer, Random Forest and Neural Network models, and MLFlow for experiment tracking.

### **Core Architecture**
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + JWT (python-jose + passlib), served by Uvicorn
- **ML Pipeline**: scikit-learn Random Forest + PyTorch MLP, preprocessing with sklearn
- **Inference**: ONNX for Random Forest, TorchScript for MLP; SHAP for explanations
- **Tracking**: MLFlow for experiment management and model versioning
- **Frontend**: Streamlit MVP (current) → React/Next.js migration (planned)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for users/profiles/habits, persisted in Docker
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with MLFlow tracking server, NGINX proxy

### **Data Flow Diagram**
```
User → Streamlit/React → FastAPI → ML Inference (RF/NN, ONNX/SHAP) → PostgreSQL
                                    ↘ MLFlow (experiments/artifacts)
```

## 🎓 Academic Guidance and Research Strategy

### **Advisor Recommendations (Prof. Fabrício)**

**Core Research Question**: *"In what scenarios does a neural network really become important and useful compared to simple linear models?"*

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Baseline Testing First**: Start with Linear Regression to establish minimum performance
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net → Random Forest → Neural Networks  
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Systematically compare all model paradigms
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Focus on when additional complexity is justified

### **Research Enhancement Opportunities**

**Fuzzy Logic Integration**: Research existing implementations in similar domains and compare efficacy against traditional methods. Develop prototype integrating fuzzy logic, test with real-world data, and document performance improvements.

### **Model Comparison Framework**
- **Linear Models**: Baseline performance establishment
- **Tree-Based**: Random Forest ensemble methods
- **Neural Networks**: MLP with complexity justification
- **Advanced**: Future integration of transformers, GNNs, multi-agent systems
