# Anti-Aging ML Application - Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** September 21, 2025  
**Current Status:** 🚨 Development Paused - Critical Issues Identified

## 🔴 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PAUSE

### **MANDATORY STOP: Scientific Validity Issues Discovered**

All development must pause until fundamental data and analysis issues are resolved. Our comprehensive analysis revealed scientifically implausible results that invalidate current synthetic data and model performance.

### **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**

1. **🔴 Unrealistic Age Correlation (0.945)**: Current synthetic data shows impossible age-biological age correlation. Real aging research maximum: 0.6-0.8
2. **🔴 Implausible Model Performance**: R² 0.97, MAE 2 years - unprecedented for biological aging (real: R² 0.6-0.8, MAE 4-8 years)
3. **🔴 Missing Genomics Standards**: No Hardy-Weinberg testing, population controls, proper genetic encoding
4. **🔴 Insufficient Statistical Rigor**: No multiple testing correction, confidence intervals, significance testing

### **Required Actions Before Resuming Development**

**Must Complete Issues #43-48 (Created September 21, 2025):**

- **Issue #43**: URGENT synthetic data realism overhaul 
- **Issue #44**: Genomics-specific preprocessing pipeline
- **Issue #45**: Realistic model performance baselines
- **Issue #46**: Advanced feature engineering for aging biology
- **Issue #47**: Statistical rigor and multiple testing correction
- **Issue #48**: Repository structure cleanup ✅ IN PROGRESS

### **Expected Outcomes After Fixes**
- Model performance will drop to realistic levels (this is scientifically correct)
- Feature importance will become biologically plausible
- Results will be defensible in thesis/peer review context
- Statistical analysis will meet genomics research standards

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This is the authoritative architecture for building the MVP and preparing thesis materials. The system consolidates FastAPI for the API layer, Random Forest and Neural Network models, and MLFlow for experiment tracking.

### **Core Architecture**
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + JWT (python-jose + passlib), served by Uvicorn
- **ML Pipeline**: scikit-learn Random Forest + PyTorch MLP, preprocessing with sklearn
- **Inference**: ONNX for Random Forest, TorchScript for MLP; SHAP for explanations
- **Tracking**: MLFlow for experiment management and model versioning
- **Frontend**: Streamlit MVP (current) → React/Next.js migration (planned)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for users/profiles/habits, persisted in Docker
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with MLFlow tracking server, NGINX proxy

### **Data Flow Diagram**
```
User → Streamlit/React → FastAPI → ML Inference (RF/NN, ONNX/SHAP) → PostgreSQL
                                    ↘ MLFlow (experiments/artifacts)
```

## 🎓 Academic Guidance and Research Strategy

### **Advisor Recommendations (Prof. Fabrício)**

**Core Research Question**: *"In what scenarios does a neural network really become important and useful compared to simple linear models?"*

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Baseline Testing First**: Start with Linear Regression to establish minimum performance
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net → Random Forest → Neural Networks  
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Systematically compare all model paradigms
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Focus on when additional complexity is justified

### **Research Enhancement Opportunities**

**Fuzzy Logic Integration**: Research existing implementations in similar domains and compare efficacy against traditional methods. Develop prototype integrating fuzzy logic, test with real-world data, and document performance improvements.

### **Model Comparison Framework**
- **Linear Models**: Baseline performance establishment
- **Tree-Based**: Random Forest ensemble methods
- **Neural Networks**: MLP with complexity justification
- **Advanced**: Future integration of transformers, GNNs, multi-agent systems
