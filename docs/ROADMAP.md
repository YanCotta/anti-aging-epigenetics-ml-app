# Anti-Aging ML Application - Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025  
**Current Status:** 🔄 Strategic Pivot – Multi-Level Uncertainty & Chaos Integration

## 🔄 STRATEGIC PIVOT – UNCERTAINTY-FIRST EXECUTION (October 2025)

### **🎯 Orientation Outcomes (October 16)**
- Inject stochastic behaviour into every interaction layer: methylation ↔ SNP ↔ lifestyle ↔ biomarkers ↔ demographic strata.
- Encode age-cohort ambiguity so improbable longevity and early decline scenarios exist in each batch.
- Extend diagnostics to cover residual variance envelopes, covariance drift, entropy of feature weights, and Monte Carlo confidence bands.
- Re-baseline models only after executing ≥100-run uncertainty sweeps; treat October 14 metrics as historical upper bounds.

### **🧭 Pivot Deliverables (Issues #49-#53)**
1. **Issue #49:** Chaos injection engine for the synthetic generator (feature-level perturbations, interaction randomizers, age bucket shufflers).  
2. **Issue #50:** Uncertainty-aware evaluation toolkit (residual distribution audit, variance decomposition, covariance heatmaps, entropy scoring).  
3. **Issue #51:** Monte Carlo experiment orchestrator (repeatable seeds, report aggregations, dashboard exports).  
4. **Issue #52:** Documentation + notebook alignment (update baseline notebook with chaos sections, skeptical narrative, professor rubric).  
5. **Issue #53:** Governance and guardrails (reproducibility toggles, chaos parameter registry, sanity checks to avoid unrealistic collapse).

> 🔔 **Reminder:** Publication-ready claims from October 14 remain documented below as historical context. All future communications must highlight the ongoing uncertainty initiative.

### **⚠️ Critical Acknowledgments**
- Results represent **upper bound** due to clean synthetic data
- Real-world performance expected to be **lower** due to biological noise, batch effects, population heterogeneity
- Single CpG site dominance (77.5%) indicates need for more diverse biomarkers
- Age-dependent performance issues (elderly R²=-0.15) require further investigation

## 🎓 Academic Guidance and Research Strategy

### **Advisor Recommendations (Prof. Fabrício)**

**Core Research Question**: *"In what scenarios does a neural network really become important and useful compared to simple linear models?"*

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Baseline Testing First**: Start with Linear Regression to establish minimum performance
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net → Random Forest → Neural Networks  
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Systematically compare all model paradigms
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Focus on when additional complexity is justified

### **Research Enhancement Opportunities**

**Fuzzy Logic Integration**: Research existing implementations in similar domains and compare efficacy against traditional methods. Develop prototype integrating fuzzy logic, test with real-world data, and document performance improvements.

### **Model Comparison Framework**
- **Linear Models**: Baseline performance establishment
- **Tree-Based**: Random Forest ensemble methods
- **Neural Networks**: MLP with complexity justification
- **Advanced**: Future integration of transformers, GNNs, multi-agent systems
