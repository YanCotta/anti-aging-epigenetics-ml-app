# Final Development Plan: Anti-Aging ML App (FastAPI + RF/NN + MLFlow)

This is the single, authoritative roadmap for building the MVP and preparing thesis materials. It consolidates project decisions: switch to FastAPI for the API layer, add a neural network alongside the Random Forest, and integrate MLFlow for experiment tracking. We keep what still serves the MVP (React/Next.js later, Postgres, Docker, ONNX/SHAP, synthetic data). Timeline remains ~6 weeks with buffer.

## ðŸŽ¯ Actionable GitHub Issues

**This development plan has been converted into 20 specific, actionable GitHub issues.**

- **Quick Start:** See `GITHUB_ISSUES.md` for an organized overview and implementation strategy
- **Detailed Issues:** See `DETAILED_ISSUES.md` for complete issue descriptions with acceptance criteria
- **Import Ready:** Use `github_issues.json` to import issues directly into GitHub via API
- **Labels & Milestones:** Pre-defined label system and milestone structure for project organization

Each issue includes:
- Clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Implementation notes and technical guidance  
- File modification lists and dependencies
- Priority levels and phase assignments
- Milestone alignment with timeline below

## Goals

- Deliver a secure, explainable ML MVP where users upload genetics + submit habits and receive a biological-age estimate and recommendations with explanations.
- Implement two ML baselines: Random Forest and a simple MLP. Track experiments with MLFlow.
- Serve predictions through a FastAPI backend (Django code remains during transition but will be replaced).

## Architecture

- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + JWT (python-jose + passlib). Uvicorn as ASGI server.
- ML: scikit-learn RF + PyTorch MLP, preprocessing with sklearn; ONNX for inference; SHAP for explanations; MLFlow for tracking.
- Frontend: React (existing app) via Axios; endpoints aligned to the FastAPI routes.
- Data: Postgres for users/profiles/habits, persisted in Docker.
- Ops: Docker Compose; add MLFlow tracking server as a service; NGINX as proxy.

Frontend strategy

- Streamlit-first: For the thesis MVP and rapid iteration, ship a Streamlit app that calls the FastAPI endpoints for auth, upload, habits, and predict. This accelerates demo/validation and simplifies visualization.
- Scale after defense: Migrate/expand the UI to a production-ready Next.js/React frontend, keeping the same API surface. React code in this repo remains a starting point for that migration.

## Phases and Milestones

Phase 1: Setup + Data (Sep 1 â€“ Sep 7)

- Scale synthetic dataset to Nâ‰ˆ5000 for model viability (train.csv) + tiny test CSVs. Keep demographics + habits.
- Validate distributions and simple rules; keep the current generator and improve later if needed.

Deliverables: datasets ready under backend/api/data/datasets/.

Phase 2: Backend + ML (Sep 8 â€“ Sep 18)

- Scaffold FastAPI app with endpoints: /health, /signup, /token, /upload-genetic, /submit-habits, /predict?model_type=rf|nn.
- Implement preprocessing pipeline; train RF baseline; export ONNX; SHAP explanations.
- Add MLP (PyTorch) small architecture; log both models to MLFlow with metrics (F1 macro or regression metrics depending on label), params, and artifacts.

Deliverables: working FastAPI endpoints locally; MLFlow runs visible; RF+NN artifacts stored.

Phase 3: Frontend + Integration (Sep 19 â€“ Sep 29)

- Build Streamlit MVP that integrates with FastAPI (upload CSV, habits form, predict with explanations). Use this for the defense demo.
- Prepare Next.js/React integration plan and stabilize API contracts so the React app (post-defense) consumes the same endpoints.

Deliverables: end-to-end flow in local Docker.

Phase 4: Docker, Testing, Validation (Sep 30 â€“ Oct 6)

- Add MLFlow service to compose; ensure health checks.
- Pytest for ML and API; aim â‰¥70% coverage; basic load test for predict endpoint.

Deliverables: compose up runs db, backend (FastAPI), frontend, nginx, mlflow; tests green.

Phase 5: Thesis + Demo (Oct 7 â€“ Oct 15 + buffer)

- Document model comparison (RF vs MLP) using MLFlow screenshots; ethics; limitations; future work.
- Record demo video; prepare slides.

## Key Decisions and Rationale

- FastAPI: lean, async, Pydantic validation, ideal for ML serving.
- Dual models: RF (strong baseline, interpretable) + MLP (captures interactions); compare in thesis.
- MLFlow: professional experiment tracking; supports model registry later.

- Issue #20: Enhanced model explanations

Backend APIs (FastAPI)

- POST /signup: create user, return bearer token
- POST /token: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm (username/password) â†’ token
- POST /upload-genetic: CSV upload; persist latest profile per user
- POST /submit-habits: JSON body; persist
- GET /predict?model_type=rf|nn: fetch latest genetic + habits, run inference, return prediction + explanations

Data/Models

- Keep current regression target (biological_age) for continuity; optionally add multi-class risk later. Ensure preprocessing consistent across train/predict; export RF to ONNX; keep PyTorch model for inference directly or via TorchScript/ONNX.

MLFlow

- Start tracking server in Docker compose at [http://mlflow:5000](http://mlflow:5000) with named volume. Use tracking URI in train scripts; log metrics, params, and artifacts (model files).

Security

- JWT via python-jose; password hashing via passlib[bcrypt]. CORS configured for frontend.

Testing

- Unit tests for preprocessing, training, prediction; API tests for auth, upload, submit, predict happy/edge paths.
