## üó∫Ô∏è Documentation Workflow

### For Current Status and Planning
1. **Start with**: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for comprehensive status, architecture, and plans
2. **For detailed tasks**: [DETAILED_ISSUES.md](DETAILED_ISSUES.md) for specific implementation requirements
3. **For history**: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete implementation history

### For Development Work
1. **Issue specifications**: [DETAILED_ISSUES.md](DETAILED_ISSUES.md) for acceptance criteria and requirements
2. **Architecture reference**: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for system design and guidance
3. **Progress tracking**: Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with session logs

### For Academic/Presentation Purposes
1. **Committee meetings**: [README_PROFESSORS.md](../README_PROFESSORS.md)
2. **Research documentation**: [ARTICLE.md](ARTICLE.md)
3. **Technical overview**: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

## üîÑ Document Relationships

```
README.md (entry point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ROADMAP.md (consolidated development plan)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DETAILED_ISSUES.md (all task specifications)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md (complete implementation history)

## ‚úÖ Consolidation Benefits

### **Reduced Complexity**
- **Before**: 17 markdown files with overlapping content
- **After**: 6 core files with clear, distinct purposes
- **Reduction**: ~65% fewer files while preserving 100% of information

### **Improved Navigation**
- Clear hierarchy and relationships between documents
- Eliminated duplicate information across multiple files
- Single source of truth for each type of information

### **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Reduced cognitive load for developers and reviewers
- Clearer update pathways (no need to update multiple files)
- Consolidated historical information in chronological order

## üìã Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Update ROADMAP.md** for all status changes, architecture decisions, and strategic guidance
2. **Update DETAILED_ISSUES.md** for new issues, requirement changes, and task specifications
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** for implementation details, session logs, and historical records
4. **Use README.md** for navigation and high-level project information only
5. **Keep academic content** in README_PROFESSORS.md and ARTICLE.md
