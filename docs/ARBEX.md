## add fuzzy logic somehow -> research implementations and compare its efficacy 

1. **Research Existing Implementations**: Look into current applications of fuzzy logic in similar domains. Identify key techniques, algorithms, and frameworks used.

2. **Compare Efficacy**: Evaluate the performance of these implementations against traditional methods. Consider metrics such as accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

3. **Prototype Development**: Based on research findings, develop a prototype that integrates fuzzy logic into the existing system.

4. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorously test the prototype to assess its performance. Use real-world data to validate its efficacy compared to previous approaches.

5. **Iterate and Improve**: Based on testing feedback, refine the fuzzy logic implementation to enhance its performance and usability.
6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document the research process, implementation details, and performance results. Prepare a report summarizing findings and recommendations for future work.
